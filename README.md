# duma

An interpreter for a more civilized age, `duma` uses weird character hats and accents in the Vietnamese language, into a programming language in its own right.

By using this, programmers are guaranteed to shout `duma` multiple times. 

For now, the code is taken from ruslanspivak's blog & blogscot's rust implementation as I am not yet fluent in Rust.
